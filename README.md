Dataset URL: https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets

Programming Language Used: Python

The main objective of doing the project is to understand the concept of Linear Regression and make a prediction by using the same.

The dataset consists of the production budget for a movie and the worldwide revenue the movie earned.
Therefore, in this case the movie budget is the independent variable and the movie revenue is the dependent variable.

Using the given data, the main aim is to determine how much revenue a movie would given a certain production budget.

What linear regression will do is try to represent the relationship between the budget and the revenue as a straight line. 
The slope tell us about the relationship between  the two variables.
 
 In addition, a statistic measure call the R-square value (coefficient of determination) is used. It tells us how close the data is to the fitted regression line. The higher the value of r-square the better the results.
